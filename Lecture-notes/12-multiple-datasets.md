# Multiple Datasets

For each dataset, you should have the following information in your hand:

  - CSV file
  - Codebook
  - Import and parsing script

Then you can ask AI any question regarding two datasets. 

## Example

> If I want to know the percentage of aboriginal enrollment in phd for each school, how to compute that?

When the code has error, ask AI to explain it step by step, one step at a time (chain of thought). Execute each step at a time to narrow down the problem.
