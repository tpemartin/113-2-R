## Programming environment

 1. [User](#1-user)
 2. [Computer](#2-computer)
 3. [Cloud](#3-cloud)

### 1. User

  - Human  
  - Speaks natural language (e.g. English, Chinese)
  - Can think with five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell)

  - Machine  
  - Speaks programming language (e.g. R, Python, Java)  
  - Can think with CPU and RAM (together is like a brain)

#### 2.1. Hard drive

  - where the data is stored

#### 2.2. CPU and RAM

  - CPU is like the brain, it can think and take action based on your command
  - RAM is like the memory, when some work for CPU needs to remember something, it will store it here

> Computer speaks programming languages (such as R, Python).

Cloud can be thought of as some computer that is not physically present, i.e. **remote** -- not local to you.

Two cloud services that we will use in this course are:

  1. POSIT Cloud
  2. AI

> POSIT Cloud is a remote computer that is designed to focus on R progarmming. It preload RStudio which is an **IDE**, Integrated Development Environment (整合開發環境),  mainly for R language.
